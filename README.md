# Night Engine

A C# game engine built on top of SDL3.

This project aims to provide a simple, Love2D-inspired API for C# developers to create games and multimedia applications using the power of SDL3.

## Project Structure

- `/Night.Engine`: The core engine library.
- `/Night.SampleGame`: A sample game demonstrating engine features.
- `/docs`: Project documentation (PRD, tasks, etc.).
- `/scripts`: Utility scripts (e.g., for fetching SDL3).

## Getting Started

(Instructions to be added once the engine is further developed)
